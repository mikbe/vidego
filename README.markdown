# Vidego

Easily convert videos for use with all your devices.

Vidego, short for Video-To-Go, is a super simple way to convert your videos to the MP4 container using H.264 codec for video and AAC stereo for audio. This allows for simple streaming that's supported on just about every platform.

Most importantly it frees you from the horrible MKV container that has infected the online video community like a puss filled herpes sore.
